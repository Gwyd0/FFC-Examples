# FFC-Examples
These are examples I used for <a href="FreeCodeCamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> (FFC), I use FFC regularly to keep my programming skills sharp.

If your not aware how FCC works for every certification you get 5 certification projects, these are meant to challenge you and are used to show what you have learnt. Thats what ive put here for your or my future use.

FFC can be very helpfull for getting a job but be aware that holding certification from an online learning platform like <a href="FreeCodeCamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a>  is an achievement, but many employers see this as a form of self-learning. This is exactly why i use FFC for self learning.
